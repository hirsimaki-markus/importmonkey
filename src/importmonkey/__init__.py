def add_path(new_path, allow_backslashes=False):
    """Adds a new path to sys.path relative to the caller's file's directory.

    The basis for the path being added is the __file__ attribute of the
    caller. If new_path argument is an absolute path, it will override
    the directory found from __file__. You can inspect by simply doing
    print(__file__).

    The path being added is returned so you can wrap the function call in
    print to help find the correct path: print(add_path(mypath)).

    Paths containing unicode characters are supported.

    Paths works differently in Windows and Unix-like systems. On Windows,
    the drive is not reset when the argument is a rooted relative path
    (e.g., "\foo").

    See pathlib documentation for details about how paths will work at
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html

    Example 1 (relative path):
        add_path("./../mydir")  # Add path from a sibling directory.
        add_path("../mydir")  # Same as above, current directory ./ is implied.
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Example 2 (absolute path):
        add_path("/home/username/mydir")
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Example 3 (Windows path. Note: Unix-like paths work on Windows.):
        add_path("C:\\Users\\myuser\\Desktop\\mydir", allow_backslashes=True)
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Args:
        new_path (str): The path to be added, relative to the caller's file.
        allow_backslashes (bool, optional): Allow backslashes in path. Default
            is False. You should only use this if you are certain you need
            backslashes. Unix-style paths can be used on Windows.

    Returns:
        str: The path that was added to sys.path.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If new_path or allow_backslashes has wrong type.
        ValueError: If new_path does not resolve to a valid directory.
        ValueError: If new_path already exists in sys.path.
        FileNotFoundError: If the caller's filepath can not be determined.
        RuntimeError: For unexpected exceptions.

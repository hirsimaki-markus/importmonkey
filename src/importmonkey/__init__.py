def add_path(new_path, allow_backslashes=False):
    """Adds a new path to sys.path. Relative paths use the caller's directory as base.

    The caller's __file__ attribute is used to get base directory for relative paths.
    If caller's __file__ is not available, current working directory is used. These can
    be inspected with "print(__file__)" and "print(os.getcwd())". If the new_path
    argument is an absolute path, the base path is ignored.

    The path being added is returned so that it may be can wrapped with print to help
    find the correct path to add like so: "print(add_path(mypath))".

    Paths containing unicode characters are supported. Paths works differently in
    Windows and Unix-like systems. On Windows, the drive is not reset when the argument
    is a rooted relative path (e.g., "\\foo").

    For more details, see pathlib (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html).

    Example, relative path:
        add_path("./../mydir")  # Add path from a sibling directory.
        add_path("../mydir")  # Same as above, current directory ./ is implied.
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Example, absolute path:
        add_path("/home/username/mydir")
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Example, Windows path (note: Unix-like paths work on Windows):
        add_path("C:\\Users\\myuser\\Desktop\\mydir", allow_backslashes=True)
        import py_file_in_mydir  # Import works now.
        py_file_in_mydir.my_func()

    Args:
        new_path (str): The path to be added.
        allow_backslashes=False (bool): Allow backslashes in path. Only use this if you
            are certain you need backslashes. Unix-style paths work on Windows.

    Returns:
        str: The resolved path which was added to sys.path or and empty string if the
            given path was already in sys.path.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If new_path or allow_backslashes has wrong type.
        ValueError: If new_path does not resolve to a valid directory.
        FileNotFoundError: If the caller's filepath can not be determined.
        RuntimeError: For unexpected exceptions.
